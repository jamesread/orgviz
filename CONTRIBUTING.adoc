= Contributions

Contributions are very welcome - code, docs, whatever they might be! If this is
your first contribution to an Open Source project or you're a core maintainer
of multiple projects, you're time and interest in contributing is most welcome.

If you're not sure where to get started, a great place to get started is a list
of link:https://github.com/orgviz/orgviz/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22[good first issues for contribution].

Ideas may be discussed, purely on their merits and issues. Our Code of Conduct
(CoC) is straightforward - it's important that contributors feel comfortable in 
discussion throughout the whole process. This project respects the 
link:https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/code-of-conduct.html[Linux Kernel code of conduct]. 

== If you're not sure, ask!

Don't be afraid to ask for advice before working on a
contribution. If you're thinking about a bigger change, especially that might
affect the core working or architecture, it's almost essential to talk and ask
about what you're planning might affect things. Some of the larger future plans may not be
documented well so it's difficult to understand how your change might affect
the general direction and roadmap of this project without asking. 

The preferred way to communicate is the Telegram chat linked in the
link:README.adoc[README], or GitHub issue.

== Setting up your development environment 

=== orgviz "module"

orgviz is a simple command line application, started with ./orgviz.py, which
loads it's module dependencies from the `orgviz` directory.

* All the meaty code lives in the `orgviz` directory.
* You will need the runtime dependencies of orgviz (configargparse, GraphViz,
  etc, see README for more info).
* `make docs` is a good test that covers a lot of orgviz code paths. 

=== Web interface

* `web.py` is a python CherryPy webserver (https://cherrypy.org/).
* `webui` is a ParcelJS (https://parceljs.org/) PWA (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_application). 
* The `parcel` command is installed via NPM - there is a `package.json` file in the `webui` directory.
* There is a makefile - `webui/Makefile` that will run parcel for you.
* "compiled" HTML+etc are put into `webui/dist` and served by `web.py`.
* The webui is controlled mostly by `webui/src/main.js`

== Mechanics of submitting a change

* Please fork, feature-branch, and PR. 
* In your PR, please provide a brief, but meaningful description that describes why you think
  this contribution is useful, and what it changes.

Thanks so much for your time! :-) 

=== Checklist - testing your changes

Before you PR, please run these checks locally;

* `make test` should run cleanly.
* `make lint` should run cleanly, avoid adding pylint ignores.
* `make docs` should run cleanly, with docs/ExampleCompany.png looking good.
